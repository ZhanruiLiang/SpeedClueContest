In the `python-core` folder, you can find the speedclue package. It contains a game server
and player proxy. They are both compatible to the java testServer and AI interface. That
means you can use:

 * python server <---> python ai
 * java server <---> python ai
 * python server <---> java ai
 * java server <---> java ai

You can find usage example of the player proxy in `python-core/simpleai.py`.

Also, `test.sh` and `testjava.sh` are provided as an usage example for the test servers.
