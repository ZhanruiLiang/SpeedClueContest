## Submitting an Entry ##

After you've submitted a pull request for your entry, you need to post an answer
to the question.  Your post should include the following information
(preferrably in the order listed):

- **Identifier**: the name you've given your AI

- **Selected**: if you submit more than one entry, and there are enough people
  entering the contest, is this the entry you want to participate in the final
  competition? (yes/no)

- **Technology**: language and additional packages/modules/libraries used

- **Arguments**: the command line arguments your program needs to run

- **Description**: a description of what makes your entry unique; this is
  especially important if it is similar to another player's entry
